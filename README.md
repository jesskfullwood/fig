# Fig

A Rust frontend web framework which aims to match the semantics of
[The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) as closely as possible.

Built on top of [`wasm_bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen).

It can be thought of as a fork of [seed](https://github.com/David-OConnor/seed),
though the only code it shares (steals) is the `fetch` implementation.
